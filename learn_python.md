## Why Python?

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux etc).  

- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.  

- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines comparing with other     programming languages.

- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or a functional way.

## Python Syntax  

- Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often   use semicolons or parentheses.  

- Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops,         functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
